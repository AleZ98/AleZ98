- 👋 Hi, I’m @AleZ98
I am a programmer passionate about technology, such as machine learning, software engineering. I love creating projects where I can help people make tasks simpler and easier to use at work, and I do it out of passion.


Here I will post all the simpler or more complex projects I've worked on.

I am very curious about programming technology and I am always learning.

Thanks. :)
